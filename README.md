This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and visualizing upper body skeleton data using OpenPose. The notebook is designed to process 2D pose keypoints and extract meaningful insights related to upper body motion.

# Features

- **Upper Body Skeleton Extraction**: Utilizes OpenPose to detect and extract upper body keypoints from 2D video data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and organizes keypoint data for further analysis.
- **Visualization**: Plots the keypoints to visualize the skeleton and motion paths over time.
- **Pose Analysis**: Computes angles or other key metrics to evaluate body posture, motion, or bending.
- **Customization**: Easily customizable for different body parts or keypoints from OpenPose data.
